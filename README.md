=====

JAnki aims to be a more user friendly implementation of the popular SRS Anki.
Some of the feature the will be implemented include:
- a uniform, accessible UI, with more keyboard control and less usage of modal popups
- enhanced card editor with autocomplete and/or basic UI editor
- improved search UI
- enhanced study planning and graph visualization
- under the hood: decoupling of domain and UI data, well defined set of API and restful services to integrate with webanki
- enhanced addon development, discovery and install
- easier extensibility

The project is based on Eclipse, in order to easily implement some of the core features such as great extensibility and software/addons updates
