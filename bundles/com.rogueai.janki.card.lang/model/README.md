This folder contains temporary models and grammars related to HTML:
* HTML.ecore : a valid ecore model for HTML (https://github.com/grammarware/slps/tree/master/topics/grammars/html/allilaire)
* Html.xtext : XText grammar generated from the above ecore. Note that this grammar has nothing to do with pure HTML, 
               it just parses a document which is structurally equivalent to HTML. Anyways, it's useful to get information 
               about the rules to construct an actual html grammar
